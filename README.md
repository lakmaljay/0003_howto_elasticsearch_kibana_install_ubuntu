## How To Install Elasticsearch and Kibana on Ubuntu Linux

The Elastic Stack is a great platform for various data analytics use-cases. But how do you get started? This video goes beyond a simple default installation of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It discusses real-world best practices for hardware sizing and configuration, providing production-level performance and reliability.

## Install Elasticsearch

#### 1. Elastic signs all of its packages with the Elasticsearch PGP Signing Key. Add this key to your server.

```
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
```

#### 2. As the packages will be retrieved via HTTPS, you will need to install the apt-transport-https package.

```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
```

#### 3. You will next need to add the Elastic repository.

There are different repositories for the standard distribution (X-Pack pre-bundled) and the Apache 2.0 licensed distribution. You will use the standard distribution in order to take advantage of the Security features of the X-Pack Basic tier.

```
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
```

#### 4. You will now need to update the local cache of available packages and their versions.

```
sudo apt update
```

#### 5. You can now install Elasticsearch.

```
sudo apt install elasticsearch
```

#### 6. Configure JVM Heap.

If a JVM is started with unequal initial and max heap sizes, it may pause as the JVM heap is resized during system usage. For this reason itâ€™s best to start the JVM with the initial and maximum heap sizes set to equal values.

Edit `/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options` and set `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to about one third of the system memory, but do not exceed `31g`. For example...

```
# Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
# Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space

-Xms8g
-Xmx8g
```

#### 7. Increase System Limits.

You should specify system limits in a systemd configuration file for the elasticsearch service.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d
```

Copy the provided file `etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d/elasticsearch.conf` to `/etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d`

Additionally, copy the provided file `etc/sysctl.d/70-elasticsearch.conf` to `/etc/sysctl.d`. Reboot the system for these changes to take effect.

#### 8. Modify the Elasticsearch configuration.

Replace the default Elasticsearch configuration file with the provided configuration by copying `etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` to `/etc/elasticsearch`

Modify this configuration as may be appropriate for your environment.

#### 9. Set the password.
```
Execute the below command to set the password for login.
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```
#### 10. Start Elasticsearch.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
```

#### 11. Enable Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system is started.

```
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
```

## Install Kibana

#### 1. Install Kibana.

```
sudo apt install kibana
```

#### 2. Modify the Kibana configuration.

Replace the default Kibana configuration file with the provided configuration by copying `etc/kibana/kibana.yml` to `/etc/kibana`

Modify this configuration as may be appropriate for your environment.

#### 3. Start Kibana.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```
sudo systemctl start kibana.service
```

Be patient. It may take a moment the first time as Kibana optimizes enabled applications.

#### 4. Enable Kibana to start automatically when the system is started.

```
sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
```
